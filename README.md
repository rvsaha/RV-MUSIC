# RV MUSIC

RV MUSIC is a modern, interactive music app inspired by Apple Music, Spotify, and YouTube Music. It features a beautiful UI, music browsing/search, playlists, favorites, and audio playback. Built with React (frontend) and Node.js/Express (backend).

## Features
- Browse, search, and play music
- Create and manage playlists
- Mark songs as favorites
- Responsive, modern UI (Material UI)

- Mock music library (backend)

## Getting Started

### Backend
1. Open a terminal in the `backend` folder.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the backend server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

### Frontend
1. Open a terminal in the `frontend` folder.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the frontend app:
   ```sh
   npm start

## Folder Structure

- Build the main UI and connect to backend endpoints
- Add playlist and favorites logic
- Polish the UI for a premium feel
